# Dan's Trello Clone

## Description

- this is a project task app that can help users manage their tasks in a way that is simple and easy to use.

### Versions and Release Notes

- v1.0 - Initial build released on 10.09.21
  - allow users to add columns and add cards to each column.
  - Once cards are created they can easily be moved across the board using arrow buttons at the bottom of each card.
  - Cards and columns can also be deleted by clicking on the X button in the top right corner of the column.
  - Currently the app is not attached to a database, so on refresh all cards are reset to the initial state.
  - Currently there is no login so cards can not be saved to a users board.
